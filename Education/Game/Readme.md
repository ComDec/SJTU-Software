## Traditional Chinese Culture

Huarong Road is an ancient Chinese folk puzzle game, which, together with rubik's cube and independent diamond chess, have been called by foreign intelligence experts as "the three incomprehensible puzzles in the field of intelligence games" for its changeable and endless features. 

It has a synonym called "China's problem" with traditional Chinese puzzle toys such as tangram and nine links. It is said in the annotation of "The Wisdom of The Ancient Times" that "from now on, the tao can reach Huarong." Huarong Road was originally a place name in ancient China. Historic records show that Cao Cao once lost here. At that time Huarong road is a marsh, so Cao Cao's army had to cut grass to fill the land. Many soldiers were buried alive, which was very tragic.

By moving each piece, we help Cao Cao(in this game is our Nano DNA) from the initial position to move to the bottom of the board in the middle, escape from the exit. Not allowed to cross pieces, but also try to use the minimum number of steps to move Cao cao to the exit.
